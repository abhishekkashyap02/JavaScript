# 🌟 JavaScript — Complete Fundamentals + Modern Concepts
**A beginner-friendly and structured repository covering everything I have learned in pure JavaScript — from basics to core logic-building topics.  
No frameworks. No advanced topics. Only modern JS fundamentals.**

## 📌 About This Repository
This repository contains all the JavaScript programs I wrote while learning JS from scratch.

It includes:
- 📖 JS basics, variables, data types, operators  
- 🔁 Loops, conditionals, functions  
- 📦 Arrays, objects, strings  
- ✨ ES6+ features (arrow functions, destructuring, spread/rest, template literals)  
- 🧠 Logic-building exercises, math problems, and patterns  
- 🧹 Clean, organized, and readable code  

Ideal for beginners looking to solidify JS fundamentals before moving to DOM, React, Node.js, or DSA.
